# **Weather Dashboard**

## **Description**

This is a simple to use application that allows you to see the current, and forecasted weather in the city you declare.
The data that shows up with the current and forecasted weather is:
>Temperature in Fahrenheit
>Wind Speed in Miles Per Hour
>Humidity Index in Percentage

The city name is saved through localStorage and applied to a button on the left-hand side.
That button re-targets the city name to quickly re-search the weather in current time.

## **Usage**

Simply type in your city by name within the search box, and click search.
Afterwards, you'll see a large section with the current date's weather (temp, wind speed, humidity), and smaller sections that show the 5-day forecast for that same city.

On the left-side, below the city-search, you'll notice that your previously searched cities are also listed.
You can click on any of the previously searched city name buttons, and automatically show that updated weather anytime.
